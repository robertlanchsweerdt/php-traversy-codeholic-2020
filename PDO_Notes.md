# PHP Database Objects (PDO)

## Why PDO?

1. Works with multiple databases besides MySQL such as PostgreSQL and Firebird.
2. Object Oriented with methods and properties
3. Security / Prepard Statements (guard against SQL injections) using 'bindings'
4. Unified API to access to multiple databases
5. Three ways to handle errors (silent, warning, exception)
